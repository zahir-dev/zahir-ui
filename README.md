## Notes about this boilerplate

Create Material-UI App is built on top of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which means all features that create-react-app supports are available.

We recommend sticking with this boilerplate for new projects since we trying to keep here the newest stable configuration.
